# Non-Intrusive Network Vulnerability Assessment System 

A passive alternative to the more traditional active scans employed for vulnerability checks.
This is a web application system using AngularJS, Bootstrap, Java 8 and MongoDB technologies, leverages the exhaustive API-available data-set and functions returned by Shodan such as banner, metadata, and exploit search capabilities.
Not meant to replace active vulnerability scans, this is nevertheless a useful and convenient application whose significant contribution lies in providing a simple yet invaluable resource for misconfiguration and vulnerability initial checks.
